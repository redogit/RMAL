# Decision Field component-analysis build report

**Date:** 2026-09-27
**Environment:** local Linux container, GCC 14.2, C++23

## TDD witness

The new component-analysis test target was written before the production header existed.

Expected RED result:

```text
fatal error: decision_field/component_analysis.hpp: No such file or directory
```

The header was then implemented and the new test target passed.

## Full verification

Command:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j2
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Result:

```text
decision_field_tests                       Passed
decision_field_self_opposite               Passed
decision_field_triadic_self_attack         Passed
decision_field_component_analysis_tests    Passed

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 4
```

## New tests

`component_analysis_tests.cpp` verifies:

1. the canonical basis contains cardinal, diagonal, lateral, orthogonal and parametric signed views;
2. only stable representative structure is joined into the simpler core while varying dimensions remain residuals;
3. components with sufficient members recursively expose component-of-component substructure.

## Claim ceiling

This verifies the current executable C++ carrier and its test assertions.

It does not establish that the current scoring function is universally optimal, that the basis is complete for every domain, or that component analysis solves an external research problem.


## Standalone decoupling recheck

The component-analysis header was then decoupled from the predecessor engine header so the new GitHub slice can build independently. The full local predecessor + component suite was rerun after this change:

```text
decision_field_tests                       PASS
decision_field_self_opposite               PASS
decision_field_triadic_self_attack         PASS
decision_field_component_analysis_tests    PASS

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 4
```

Current standalone component header SHA-256:

```text
027a3bf6f948c2c4db158b5d16d5fc5ebdcc82232c22f4c48ff1106706cc6819
```


## Exact standalone GitHub-slice witness

A clean temporary tree containing only the branch's standalone files was configured and built:

```text
CMake configure: PASS
C++23 compile:   PASS
decision_field_component_analysis_tests: PASS

100% tests passed, 0 failed out of 1
```

Verified file hashes:

```text
component_analysis.hpp
027a3bf6f948c2c4db158b5d16d5fc5ebdcc82232c22f4c48ff1106706cc6819

```


## Review-discovered core-collapse counterexample

A review counterexample was added after the initial implementation.

Two retained components had representatives with the same first coordinate, but one non-representative retained member differed on that coordinate. The original representative-only join incorrectly admitted the coordinate into the simpler core.

Expected RED:

```text
CHECK failed: !result.simpler_core.stable_parameters[0].has_value()
```

Repair:

```text
join representatives only
-> join every retained member of every retained primary component
```

Post-repair full local suite:

```text
4/4 PASS
```

Post-repair standalone GitHub slice:

```text
1/1 PASS
```
