# Directional Component Analysis Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build an obligation-relative up/down/left/right/diagonal/lateral/orthogonal/parametric component-of-component analyzer that reduces explored Decision Field states to a simpler recoverable core without erasing residual distinctions.

**Architecture:** Keep the existing Decision Field exploration semantics separate from the new component layer. Convert explored states into explicit `ComponentObservation` records, project them onto typed signed bases, recursively decompose strong components, then join only representative coordinates that remain stable within tolerance. Preserve every non-collapsible coordinate as a residual and replay the simpler-core candidate against the original obligations before admission.

**Tech Stack:** ISO C++23, CMake >= 3.25, CTest. RMAL/RMALC remain a separate root C23 toolchain and are not modified by this subproject.

**Spec:** `projects/decision-field/docs/DESIGN.md`

## Global Constraints

- Object identity remains recoverable while coordinates/representations may change.
- `GENERATE != VERIFY != ADMIT`.
- `SUCCESS != OPTIMAL`.
- `REPETITION != PROOF`.
- `RELATED != SUPPORTS`.
- `METHOD_TRANSFER != EVIDENCE_TRANSFER`.
- Directional components are obligation-relative; `PRIMARY != PRINCIPAL_VARIANCE_BY_DEFAULT`.
- Simplification must retain every non-collapsible dimension as a residual.
- Existing v0.3 self-opposite and triadic evidence is predecessor evidence and may not be retroactively rewritten.
- Root RMAL/RMALC C23 build authority remains unchanged.

## Review Focus

1. Zero or dimension-mismatched basis vectors must fail explicitly rather than silently normalize.
2. Opposite signed directions must remain distinct even when they share an underlying parameter.
3. Recursive component analysis must not rediscover the excluded parent basis as its own child.
4. A varying representative dimension must remain residual rather than being averaged into the simpler core.
5. High geometric projection with negative obligation/evidence quality must not outrank obligation-relevant components.

## Current verification checkpoint

Local full predecessor + component suite:

```text
decision_field_tests                       PASS
decision_field_self_opposite               PASS
decision_field_triadic_self_attack         PASS
decision_field_component_analysis_tests    PASS
```

The repository subfolder intentionally exposes the new component layer as an isolated build while preserving predecessor hashes/reports separately.
